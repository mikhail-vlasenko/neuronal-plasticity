# Biologically Plausible Plasticity

This project constructs the minimal set of rules for robust biologically plausible learning based on
dopamine-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Furthermore, we apply the developed
method to the existing realistic model of a column in mouse V1 and observe stable learning.
